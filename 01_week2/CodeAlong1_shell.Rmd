## common problems

* Sometimes youâ€™ll run the code and nothing happens.
* Putting the + in the wrong place.

How to get help

* ? function name
* Select the function name and press F1

## facets


## geometric objects

different visual object to represent data



not every aesthetic works with every geom



two geoms in the same graph!


local vs. global mappings
This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.


specify different data for each layer



## statistical transformation

## position adjustments

adjustments for bar charts


adjustments for scatterplots



## coordinate systems

switch x and y



set the aspect ratio correctly for maps



Polar coordinates reveal an interesting connection between a bar chart and a Coxcomb chart.


## the layered grammar of graphics

The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe any plot as a combination of:

* a dataset, 
* a geom, 
* a set of mappings, 
* a stat, 
* a position adjustment, 
* a coordinate system, and 
* a faceting scheme.
