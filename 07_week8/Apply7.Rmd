## Goal
Visualize and compare skewness of your portfolio and its assets.

Choose your stocks.

from 2012-12-31 to 2017-12-31

## 1 Import stock prices


## 2 Convert prices to returns (monthly)


## 3 Assign a weight to each asset (change the weigting scheme)


## 4 Build a portfolio


## 5 Compute Skewness


## 6 Plot: Skewness Comparison

Is any asset in your portfolio more likely to return extreme positive returns than your portfolio collectively? Discuss in terms of skewness. You may also refer to the distribution of returns you plotted in Code along 4.
