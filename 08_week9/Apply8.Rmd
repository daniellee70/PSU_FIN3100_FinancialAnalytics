from 2012-12-31 to present

## 1 Import stock prices


## 2 Convert prices to returns (monthly)


## 3 Assign a weight to each asset (change the weigting scheme)


## 4 Build a portfolio


## 5 Compute kurtosis


## 6 Plot: Rolling kurtosis

Has the downside risk of your portfolio increased or decreased over time? Explain using the plot you created. You may also refer to the skewness of the returns distribution you plotted in the previous assignment.
